================================
#### By Daniel Amiri-Fear, Gioanna Rheumer & Negar Amiri

### Traveller is a collaborative trip-planning web application. It allows users to create trips, invite their friends to join and dynamically add itineraries and then attractions or notes to each itinerary. Users can also amend and delete intineraries or trips too.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `bundle install` command.
3. Create PostgreSQL database manually.
4. Apply data into the application using the `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:create` and `rails db:seed` commands.
5. Start the web server using the `rails s` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/>.
6. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
